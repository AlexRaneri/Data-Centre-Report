During my final year in Chemical Engineering, for the module "Environmental and Engineering Project Management", I designed an energy supply for a data centre, performing Life-Cycle Inventories for renewable energy sources with technical comparison, Impact Assessments on wildlife and society, cost estimates, project execution strategy. I drafted an Operations and Maintenance Philosophy, upholding the values of sustainability, safety, honesty and accuracy.
